MentorMe is a responsive design tailored to working with youths whose only source of internet may be their phone. On the organization side, most administrators have access to a computer, while many of the mentors working with the youths may be a mix. A mentoring organizations ability to customize their entire enrollment program is substantial. From personalized emails, to custom forms, to building a step by step enrollment process from those forms or templated forms there is no limit to the kind of Mentoring program an organization can set up here.

Organizations have the ability to create matches of 1-1, or even several Mentors / Mentees in one team. The mentors & mentees then have the ability to "Check In" after a session, upload photos, and rate/comment on the overall meeting experience. Organizations can then track the overall satisfaction of the match.

Additional metrics are tabulated to show enrollments, conversion, enrollment progress, etc...
